"""Views that serve the built React frontend from the Django backend.

The Vite build output (``Frontend/dist``) is served at the site root so the
application is reachable from a single URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000). During
development the Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173) remains the preferred
way to work on the frontend.
